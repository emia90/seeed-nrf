# seeed-nrf
I am currently working on a project involving the ICM42670P sensor,  and I have successfully implemented the code on an Arduino Mega 2560. However,  when I attempt to run the same code on the Seeed nRF52840 board,   I encounter issues and it does not function as expected. even when i scaneed to find address with it, I2C device not found .
